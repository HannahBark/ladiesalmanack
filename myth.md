# Mythology

In Ladies Almanack, Djuna Barnes makes use of mythological characters, stories, and symbols to play with the structure and content of her book. In the month of February, the omniscient narrator exclaims “Oh Zeus! Oh Diane! Oh Hellebore! Oh Absalom! Oh Piscary Right!” on page 17. In mythology, Zeus was the ruler of all the gods; Diane was the goddess of nature and the hunt. Barnes includes a cry for mythological gods as opposed to the Christian God and angels to show she is not particularly religious but still wants to experiment in religious text. Religious people reading her work would disagree with her use of many gods, instead of their one. Absalom was one son of David in the Bible, specifically 2 Samuel. “Piscary rights” are rights that people need to have to fish in certain areas; hellebore is a plant. Barnes uses gods, biblical figures, and fishing licenses to create a sense of absurdity in the crying out in her work. She shows that asking for help from a heavenly being is as pointless as calling out for an herb to save the day. Barnes has no use for the church and displays that through her writing. 

In August, Barnes includes a picture of the zodiac signs (below). Zodiac signs are separated for specific dates. Each symbol has an accompanying mythological story or character. Barnes may have incorporated this into her chapter to emphasis the nontraditional, nonreligious life she lived. The signs and myths are not taught in the church or particularly encouraged. Also, Barnes separated her work into the different months to signify new themes or shifts in structure. Each chapter is unique just as each zodiac sign is unique. 

Throughout the different stories in mythology, homosexuality was not condemned for the most part. In “Homosexuality in Greek Myth”, Sergent explained that homosexuality was common in  myths. Barnes used mythology in her work for evidence that other religious ideas supported homosexuality. Barnes abandoned the traditional church that rejected the lifestyle altogether and embraced mythological references in Ladies Almanack. Barnes saw around her that homosexuality was not uncommon and used references that proved her point.
