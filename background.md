# Background 

Djuna Barnes embraced every characteristic of her heroic protagonist, Dame Musset, throughout her lifetime. Growing up in the early 20th century to a violent, polygamist father, Barnes was not allowed to learn in the public school system. Some resources imply Barnes had a sexual relationship with her grandmother. As she grew older, she beat the odds and became a journalist for magazines like _Vanity Fair_. She was a heavy drinker and a recluse. Barnes life was impacted from her suffocating childhood. 

Barnes’ religious views appear in her novel, _Nightwood_. She claims that “the people love their church and know it, as a dog knows where he was made to conform, and there he returns by his instinct.” Much of _Ladies Almanack_ seems to be mocking religious institutions and the minds of religious people. This statement reveals that Barnes did not have a god in her life. Many people turn away from church altogether when tragedy occurs. In "December", Barnes includes the phrase "month of the year when proof of God dies." Her childhood could be the reason she has no religious thoughts. The church is also against homosexuality, which was a major part of Barnes’s life. Barnes perhaps was religious or interested in the church at one part of her life, but the combination of a bitter childhood and corrupt church system destroyed her proof of any god. Her text in _Ladies Almanack_ shows that she abandoned the church and used a large portion of her life to fight against their narrow-minded ways. Barnes was a “pioneer” just as Dame Musset was.
