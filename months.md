# Months

## January
Barnes uses January, a cold, frigid month, to represent the old, traditional views of the church. She introduces the character of Patience Scalpel who “could not understand women and their ways.” Patience belongs in the past. This specific past is the way of religious people and churches. In “The Truth About Homosexuality: The Cry of the Faithful”, John Harvey has the same view as Patience, that homosexuality is sin and “above” and “before” him. In his work, he contrasts different women’s scenarios to their past of homosexuality to explain his argument that the lifestyle is destructive. In “Homosexuality, Power & Politics ,” a section includes the observation that women are condemned as whores when they have sexual desires, while men are simply natural when they have the same urges. Patience calls the women in this chapter “sluts”, showing she has the same beliefs described in this section. Barnes writes Patience in a particular way that the reader would assume Patience has the mindset of the past. 


## February 
February is structured as a “love letter for a present.” The reader can understand that the writer is Dame Musset, the protagonist and hero of the novel. In the Bible, Song of Solomon is considered a love letter. The first few verses are “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine; your anointing oils are fragrant.” In this book overall, Barnes seems to be taking a jab at the narrow-minded ways of the church. The church rejects homosexuality, refuses to see it as a legal necessity to some, and considers it a blatant sin. By structuring her chapter like a book of the Bible, a book religious people value, Barnes is creating  her own religion, one that rejoices in homosexuality and freedom of love. 


## March

In March, two new characters are introduced, Lady Buck-and-Balk and Tilly-Tweed-in-Blood, and they question the “Good Dame Musset” over tea.The conversation is over lesbianism, “bosom to bosom”, and Barnes takes another opportunity to use the Bible as her own resource for _Ladies Almanack_. Lady exclaims about a “rib gone astray”; this refers to the story of creation in Genesis. God “made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man” and gave Adam a helper and wife. Barnes could be poking fun that churches claim women were made to serve man, and now women are loving women with no men in the equation. In “Female Homosexuality: A Psychodynamic Study of Lesbianism”, Caprio argues that female homosexuality is more frequent, and that lesbianism is more common in society. Barnes’ book encourages this fact by excluding men from the work and lifting up the idea of female love. 


## April

Barnes structures April in the same way a doctor’s diagnosis is organized: side effects. The first few lines of the chapter include a “brief of though, cut of concentration.” Diseases or sicknesses have similar symptoms like “restlessness at night” like in April. Barnes could be comparing homosexuality to a disease, like the traditional and modern day church would do. In “Female Homosexuality: A Psychodynamic Study of Lesbianism”, Caprio refers to homosexuality as the “hidden disease”, highlighting what others think of the lifestyle. The church would agree with this argument; Barnes chooses to mock that fact. 

## May 

Barnes uses this chapter to introduce another character named Bounding Bess and convey her admiration of powerful women throughout history. After observing Bess for a moment, Dame Musset learns that Bounding Bess is just another woman that studies written history and does nothing with the information but spout random facts whenever she gets the chance. Musset explains how she used her promiscuity to learn about more history than they have written in books. Barnes is comparing the legitimacy of written history to oral history.

## June

June is set up as a poem, followed by a scene of dialogue between Doll and Musset. While going “for a walk”, Doll brings up the biblical character of Jezebel. In the Bible, Jezebel was a scheming, evil woman who used her body to her advantage. Doll tells a story of Jezebel leaning out a window to seduce Sheba, but ultimately calling out her “last Uoo Hoo.” In 2 Kings, Jezebel was tossed out a window to her death. As the guards went to bury her “they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.” A prophet proclaimed that it would be her dogs that would eat her, creating a dirty, depressing legacy. In this section, Doll is becoming a pessimist. She is concerned with death in all aspects of her life, talking about it on walks with her love. Doll created a love story between Jezebel and Sheba and still mentioned Jezebel’s death of the window. Doll understands that no matter how she lives or who she loves, she will die in the end. 


## July
![july](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RqFBUGx5BIM/WJ-EgKLE3lI/AAAAAAAAAGA/4asqNDxuGn4cPw2W5oxL6UJGQYrmdILxgCLcB/s0/july.jpg "july")

The month of July is narrated by an unknown maid that is currently writing a love letter and confessing her love to another unknown maid. This chapter compares the love of a man and the love of a woman. When a man is in love he typically gives his love a name of endearment such as "Honey Lou", "Snooky Dear", or "my great big, beautiful bedridden Doll." When a woman is in love she cares more about her love's wellbeing and health. Later on in the chapter, Barnes uses the example "..should her Honey-heart hang mincemeat Tartlets about her Waist for a Girdle.." to show that love will make people do crazy things they wouldn't normally do. 

## August
![august](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wuGQ2iqbsr4/WJ-EWRUG6UI/AAAAAAAAAF4/7pmAz8CyODMrcmsDH5x6VoA-Uygvyv9LQCLcB/s0/august.png "august")

In August, Musset is becoming more irritated than previous chapters. The reason could be a depressed lover or the traditional views of the world holding back her heroic cause, but Barnes does not state directly. Both reasons fit the context and flow of the chapters. In August, Barnes brings up the Bible once again in Musset’s voice. Dame says that the “Camel is forever facing a needle.” The book of Matthew says that “For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” Although the content of the two statements are different, Barnes is still mimicking the holy word to her advantage and to create a tone that is cutting (to the church) and deep (to the readers). Barnes is showing that she is against the religious people that accuse homosexuality as being “sin against nature”, as stated in “Homosexuality, a History” by Vern L. Bullough. She also wants her readers to know she is not ignorant of the scriptures; she understands them and molds the verses into her style of writing. In “Homosexuality & Civilization”, Crompton explains that many readers misinterpret biblical passages to achieve their own goal. Barnes is doing just that on purpose for her book celebrating women and free love.

## September 
September is a written as an observation of the natural stages of life. Barnes writes through youth to the first time skin begins to sag. She describes the “Garden of Oblivion” where every living thing goes to die. Although this chapter seems melancholy and out of place in this feminist book, the chapter is about life overall. Doll seemed to be hinting at this fact in previous chapters, and Dame Musset realizes that she will die. Barnes does not intend for this chapter to rid her readers of everything she wrote so far. She is celebrating the fact that everyone has the same fate. How can church officials and religious fanatics curse homosexuals for loving when everyone will end up in the earth? Barnes understood this. In “Homosexuality and Christian Faith: Questions of Conscience for the Churches”, the book argues that the old traditional ways condemned almost every form of entertainment as sin . Religious people believed that intercourse without the finished product of a child was against God. Barnes saw that nobody would ever be good enough in the eyes of the church. This chapter shows that everyone will die, but while they live, they should live for their personal gratification, no one else’s. 

## October 

In this chapter Dame Musset is describing how she would create her perfect partner, made out of pieces from her previous ones. "If I would have my Scullion's Eye lie in the Head of Billings-On-Coo, with the Breasts of Haughty  on the Hips of Doll, on the Leg of Moll, the the Shins of Mazie, under the Scullion's Eye which lies in the Head of Billings-On-Coo. The Buttocks of a girl I saw take a slip and slither one peelish day in Fall...." Musset is heartbroken over Doll breaking up with her in June and she's trying to move on, but Patience Scalpel only gives her bad advice to sleep with a big, strong man, instead of constantly dealing with women because Patience feels that a man can fill what a woman can't.

## November 

Musset is portrayed as a slightly crazy woman that is now fify years old and telling young women that love is pointless because it will only lead to heartbreak and that they should focus on becoming wiser. Musset now knows the positives and negatives of love and she feels that since she has gained so much knowledge, she should share her information with those in their twenties because she doesn't want more women to become like her: old, alone, and miserable. Musset even goes so far as to stop two girls and tries to relay her message.

## December 
![dec](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-215b33ZMq7Q/WKGyLeHlTDI/AAAAAAAAAIg/qvFX1UWzyZ4RlxyeWND9tzM0m-eJmo_UQCLcB/s0/dec.jpg "dec.jpg")

Unfortunately Dame Musset has passed and this chapter is either her narrating her own funeral or Musset visualizing how she wants her funeral to be organized and how she wants people to react. She talks about how a baby can only be born of a hand or foot, but people can die and be buried in a multitude of ways. "..plan differently, for if you burn me first, how shall you lay me out for shriving, and how if you drop me in Ocean, can you also bind me with Earth?" Musset believes that humans are made from the Earth, birthed from women and, depending on how humans return, might not become one with it again. Barnes could have also used this chapter and Musset to explain how she wants her funeral to be: attended by many, forty women with shaved heads, buried in the capital, and one with the Earth.

Barnes also uses Musset's death to make another biblical reference. Barnes writes that Musset was "sealed in a Tomb for many days, and the women twittered about the Tomb like birds about the border of a storm." In Mark in the Bible, Jesus was sealed in tomb. The verse says "Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen." Jesus was missed and taken care of after his death, just like Musset. Barnes could be comparing the Christians' leader to the women's leader in her book to show she believes Musset is just as daring and important. Musset saved women and the ablility to love, just as Jesus saved many from sin. Musset is involved in the sin of homosexuality according to the church. Barnes is displaying she is daring as well to make this comparison.
