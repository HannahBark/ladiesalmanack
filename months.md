# Months

## January
Barnes uses January, a cold, frigid month, to represent the old, traditional views of the church. She introduces the character of Patience Scalpel who “could not understand women and their ways.” Patience belongs in the past. This specific past is the way of religious people and churches. In “The Truth About Homosexuality: The Cry of the Faithful”, John Harvey has the same view as Patience, that homosexuality is sin and “above” and “before” him. In his work, he contrasts different women’s scenarios to their past of homosexuality to explain his argument that the lifestyle is destructive. In “Homosexuality, Power & Politics ,” a section includes the observation that women are condemned as whores when they have sexual desires, while men are simply natural when they have the same urges. Patience calls the women in this chapter “sluts”, showing she has the same beliefs described in this section. Barnes writes Patience in a particular way that the reader would assume Patience has the mindset of the past. 


## February 
February is structured as a “love letter for a present.” The reader can understand that the writer is Dame Musset, the protagonist and hero of the novel. In the Bible, Song of Solomon is considered a love letter. The first few verses are “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine; your anointing oils are fragrant.” In this book overall, Barnes seems to be taking a jab at the narrow-minded ways of the church. The church rejects homosexuality, refuses to see it as a legal necessity to some, and considers it a blatant sin. By structuring her chapter like a book of the Bible, a book religious people value, Barnes is creating  her own religion, one that rejoices in homosexuality and freedom of love. 


## March

In March, two new characters are introduced, Lady Buck-and-Balk and Tilly-Tweed-in-Blood, and they question the “Good Dame Musset” over tea.The conversation is over lesbianism, “bosom to bosom”, and Barnes takes another opportunity to use the Bible as her own resource for Ladies Almanack. Lady exclaims about a “rib gone astray”; this refers to the story of creation in Genesis. God “made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man” and gave Adam a helper and wife. Barnes could be poking fun that churches claim women were made to serve man, and now women are loving women with no men in the equation. In “Female Homosexuality: A Psychodynamic Study of Lesbianism”, Caprio argues that women are homosexual than men, and that lesbianism is more common in society. Barnes’ book encourages this fact by excluding men from the work and lifting up the idea of female love. 


## April

Barnes structures April in the same a doctor’s diagnosis is organized: side effects. The first few lines of the chapter include a “brief of though, cut of concentration.” Diseases or sicknesses have similar symptoms like “restlessness at night” like in April. Barnes could be comparing homosexuality to a disease, like the traditional and modern day church would do. In “Female Homosexuality: A Psychodynamic Study of Lesbianism”, Caprio refers to homosexuality as the “hidden disease”, highlighting what others think of the lifestyle. The church would agree with this argument; Barnes chooses to mock that fact. 

## May 

## June

June is set up as a poem, followed by a scene of dialogue between Doll and Musset. While going “for a walk”, Doll brings up the biblical character of Jezebel. In the Bible, Jezebel was a scheming, evil woman who used her body to her advantage. Doll tells a story of Jezebel leaning out a window to seduce Sheba, but ultimately calling out her “last Uoo Hoo.” In 2 Kings, Jezebel was tossed out a window to her death. As the guards went to bury her “they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.” A prophet proclaimed that it would be her dogs that would eat her, creating a dirty, depressing legacy. In this section, Doll is becoming a pessimist. She is concerned with death in all aspects of her life, talking about it on walks with her love. Doll created a love story between Jezebel and Sheba and still mentioned Jezebel’s death of the window. Doll understands that no matter how she lives or who she loves, she will die in the end.

## August

In August, Musset is becoming more irritated than previous chapters. The reason could be a depressed lover or the traditional views of the world holding back her heroic cause, but Barnes does not state directly. Both reasons fit the context and flow of the chapters. In August, Barnes brings up the Bible once again in Musset’s voice. Dame says that the “Camel is forever facing a needle.” The book of Matthew says that “For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” Although the content of the two statements are different, Barnes is still mimicking the holy word to her advantage and to create a tone that is cutting (to the church) and deep (to the readers). Barnes is showing that she is against the religious people that accuse homosexuality as being “sin against nature”, as stated in “Homosexuality, a History” by Vern L. Bullough. She also wants her readers to know she is not ignorant of the scriptures; she understands them and molds the verses into her form of religion. In “Homosexuality & Civilization”, Crompton explains that many readers misinterpret biblical passages to achieve their own goal. Barnes is doing just that on purpose for her book celebrating women and free love.
