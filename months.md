# Months

## January
Barnes uses January, a cold, frigid month, to represent the old, traditional views of the church. She introduces the character of Patience Scalpel who “could not understand women and their ways.” Patience belongs in the past. This specific past is the way of religious people and churches. In “The Truth About Homosexuality: The Cry of the Faithful”, John Harvey has the same view as Patience, that homosexuality is sin and “above” and “before” him. In his work, he contrasts different women’s scenarios to their past of homosexuality to explain his argument that the lifestyle is destructive. Barnes writes Patience in a particular way that the reader would assume Patience has that attitude as well. 


## February 
February is structured as a “love letter for a present.” The reader can understand that the writer is Dame Musset, the protagonist and hero of the novel. In the Bible, Song of Solomon is considered a love letter. The first few verses are “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine; your anointing oils are fragrant.” In this book overall, Barnes seems to be taking a jab at the narrow-minded ways of the church. The church rejects homosexuality, refuses to see it as a legal necessity to some, and considers it a blatant sin. By structuring her chapter like a book of the Bible, a book religious people value, Barnes is creating  her own religion, one that rejoices in homosexuality and freedom of love. 


## March

In March, two new characters are introduced, Lady Buck-and-Balk and Tilly-Tweed-in-Blood, and they question the “Good Dame Musset” over tea.The conversation is over lesbianism, “bosom to bosom”, and Barnes takes another opportunity to use the Bible as her own resource for Ladies Almanack. Lady exclaims about a “rib gone astray”; this refers to the story of creation in Genesis. God “made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man” and gave Adam a helper and wife. Barnes could be poking fun that churches claim women were made to serve man, and now women are loving women with no men in the equation. In “Female Homosexuality: A Psychodynamic Study of Lesbianism”, Caprio argues that women are homosexual than men, and that lesbianism is more common in society. Barnes’ book encourages this fact by excluding men from the work and lifting up the idea of female love. 


## April

Barnes structures April in the same a doctor’s diagnosis is organized: side effects. The first few lines of the chapter include a “brief of though, cut of concentration.” Diseases or sicknesses have similar symptoms like “restlessness at night” like in April. Barnes could be comparing homosexuality to a disease, like the traditional and modern day church would do. In “Female Homosexuality: A Psychodynamic Study of Lesbianism”, Caprio refers to homosexuality as the “hidden disease”, highlighting what others think of the lifestyle. The church would agree with this argument; Barnes chooses to mock that fact.
